# Memory Game Project

Memory Game Project tests the players ability to remember patterns by attempting to match pairs of cards. While attempting to find the pairs, the amount of moves and time it takes them to find all the pairs is recorded.

## Instructions

Game does not require any additional dependencies.

When first card is clicked, a timer starts.

As player continues to click, their moves are counted and will be reflected in the amount of stars they have.

The goal is to match all cards.

If the player needs to restart the game for any reason, there is a reset button provided on the top right that re-shuffles the deck.

Once all cards are matched a congratulatory pop up window will congratulate the player on winning the game. The pop up will also report the amount of seconds it took to win the game and how many stars were left.

If interested in playing again, there is a button provided that closes pop up window and resets the deck.

If there is no interest in playing again simply use the 'X' close button located on the top right pop up window and close the page.
